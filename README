Highlights
============

Highlights is a simple prototype of a web interface to analyze documents.
Highlights accept a document, parse it and return the document marked up with
saliency information. 

Using a blue-red binary gradient blue information is the less important one, 
while red information is the most important.


---------------
Architecture:

Interesting stuff is behind the scenes.

Frontend:
    interface code is made with react.js and packaged with webpack

Backend:
    a microservices node backend serve the react.js app. The gateway is a reverse proxy
    with nginx. Gateway send compiled react frontend while default root is called. Then
    successive call are routed to a node.js express server. Next may be used to server-side
    rendering. Backend microservices are orchestrated via docker-compose.
